# Brahman.files

My [dotfiles](https://github.com/Libbum/dotfiles) setup has served me well for a good 5 years now.
But technology moves on and with it the tools we use. 
I've started to update my toolset, styles and practices -- so in with the old and out with the new.

Many things that I have in the old repository will be kept for compatibility with old systems and remote servers (for example: supercomputers with ancient versions of bash/whatever).

Many things in this repo may not be suited to your needs either.
I'm using Arch linux and some bleeding edge tools (like [Alacritty](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty) for a terminal, [neovim](https://neovim.io/) as a default editor etc.) which may break or change constantly.
Also the [workman](https://github.com/ojbucao/workman) keyboard layout, so yeah.
Maybe you'll find a neat trick here, but I'm not sure you'll want exactly the same stack.

## Deployment

Follow the instructions [here](https://legacy-developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/).
This is by far the best method I've come across to manage your `.files`.
